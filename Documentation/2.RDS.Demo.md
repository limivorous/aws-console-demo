# Relational Database Service
## Preamble
In this section we are creating a managed database to showcase a number of features.
We are going to be using SQL Server as that is directly relatable but might not be the final choice for customers.

## RDS Demo
Create a database
Select SQL Server and SQL Server Standard Edition
Use Production.
Change DB Instance class to db.m4.large
Ensure Multi-AZ is set to yes.
DB Instance identified – DemoDB
Master Username – sysdba
Master password – anythingyoulike

Ensure VPC is Demo VPC
Change subnet group to demo-data-subnet-grp

Ensure Public accessibility is set to no.

Choose existing VPC Security Groups and select “Demo Database Security group” – remove ‘Default”

Ensure encryption is enabled

Create database.
This will take a few minutes to complete.
Things to note about what we have just created; this is a highly available database with a read replica in a separate AZ. It is encrypted at rest and is automatically backed up.
