#####Relational Database Service
In this section we are creating a managed database to showcase a number of features.
We are going to be using SQL Server as that is directly relatable but might not be the final choice for customers.

Create a database
Select SQL Server and SQL Server Standard Edition
Use Production.
Change DB Instance class to db.m4.large
Ensure Multi-AZ is set to yes.
DB Instance identified – DemoDB
Master Username – sysdba
Master password – anythingyoulike

Ensure VPC is Demo VPC
Change subnet group to demo-data-subnet-grp

Ensure Public accessibility is set to no.

Choose existing VPC Security Groups and select “Demo Database Security group” – remove ‘Default”

Ensure encryption is enabled

Create database.
This will take a few minutes to complete.
Things to note about what we have just created; this is a highly available database with a read replica in a separate AZ. It is encrypted at rest and is automatically backed up.


Create some storage

Login to S3 – create a simple bucket. These names need to be unique so pick your name plus the date so: awsdemoamuk-28022019 Then just hit create.
Note the region you are creating it in as from this screen you can create buckets anywhere in the world.

Leave the defaults as they are and upload the well architected file in the resources folder:
https://github.com/limivorous/aws-console-demo/Resources/AWS_Well-Architected_Framework_Nov_2018.pdf 


This file now enjoys the 11 9s of durability. 

Now create an encrypted bucket. Choose the same name as before (awsdemoamuk -28022019) but add on encrypted so you create a bucket called awsdemoamuk-28022019-encrypted.
Instead of hitting “Create” on the initial screen hit next and configure the following options:

Versioning – turn this on
Default encryption – set this to auto encrypt. Leave with AES-256 as we are not going to use AWS-KMS art this point.

Click Next and show that public access for this bucket is blocked. 
There were instances of people opening up buckets to the world so AWS introduced this feature to help customers control the public exposure of their buckets.
Next.
Create

Repeat the exercise of uploading a file in S3 but this time into the encrypted bucket.
When you select the file after uploading you will notice that the file is now encrypted

and trying to use the link to open the file results in a permissions error.
