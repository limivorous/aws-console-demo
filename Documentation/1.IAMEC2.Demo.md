# IAM & EC2 Demo
## Preamble
This is the first of a number of demos within AWS specifically around the console.  
In this demo we are going to look at Identity & Access Management (IAM) as well as the Elastic Compute (EC2) services.  
Following the instructions will show you how to create a user within IAM and then use that user to create some servers within the EC2 service.

## Requirements
You should already have already followed the initial instructions to run the setup ([here](./README.md)).



## IAM Demo
This quick demo shows how to create a user and add 2 Factor Authentication to the user we create. Once we have created the user we will then use it for the rest of the demo(s).  
Note: It is not a good idea to continually use the root login for day-to-day administration tasks and therefore we create individual administrator accounts for people to login with. 

#### Login to the console  
Connect into AWS as the root/administrator of the account using the root console access.  
Once you are connected to the main menu do the following:

1. From the "Services" menu go to:
    * Security, Identity & Compliance -> IAM
    * Users-> Add User (On the screen below)
  
    ![Add User Image](Images/AddUser.png "Add User")
    
2. Within the “Add User” screen:  
    * Username – pick a name you can remember!  
    * Access Type - Enable AWS Management console access, you do not need programmatic access.  
    * For the console password use a custom password and remember it.  
    * Uncheck the require password reset  

3. Go through to the permissions screen:  
    * Attach existing policies directly  
    * Select/tick administrator access  
    * Skip through Tags, Review and then Create User.
    * Once you have created the user close the success screen.

4. Go back to the users screen within IAM.  
    * Select the user you just created
    * Take a note of the console sign in link (as below); you will need this shortly.

    ![Sign In Link Image](Images/SignInLink.png "Sign In Link")

5. Within the summary screen for that user select security credentials
    * Click on Assigned MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) device and follow the instructions to set it up.  
    At this point you will need either a Google Authenticator on your phone or a Yubikey.

6. Logout of the console; you are now going to login with the user you just created.

7. Paste the URL that you took note of above into your browser.  
    This will give you a screen such as:

    ![alt text](Images/Login.png "Logo Title Text 1")

    Note that you are logging in with the account ID as one of the fields on this screen. This is because you are now logging in as an IAM user within the account and not as a root account. 

8. Login to the console using the username and the password you just created (This will require MFA at this point).  
You are now logged in with the user you just created with the role of administrator (the policy you set) using MFA.

There are no charges for extra users so no costs will be incurred from the above.

### End of IAM Demo - What have we done?
When you initially create an AWS account you are logging in as the "root" or "owner" of that account which is impractical, and a potential security risk, for multiple administrators to work on the account.  
The steps above create an account for a specific user, give that user administrator permissions and then enforce Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) on that account.  
At the end we logged into our account using the user we created in this demo, we will now continue using that user for the rest of the demo(s).



## EC2 Demo

In this section we are showing how to create windows instances and connect to them remotely.   
The servers will only be billed as we are using them in an “on demand” fashion so once we are done with them we can shut them down.  
During the demo we will create a "Key Pair" for increased security of our servers, create multiple servers through the console and then connect using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to one of those servers.

So, ensuring that you are still logged in with the user we created above: 


#### Key Pair
Initially we need to create a keypair. 
AWS uses key pairs to encyrpt and decrypt the administrator logins to servers so without the key pair you can't decrypt and retrieve the login credentials!  

1. From the console go to Computing -> EC2 -> Networking & Security -> Key Pairs  
    * Create a key pair. Call it something you can remember: e.g. *yourname*DemoKeyPair  
    * Save this to disk, you will need this later so remember where you save it.  

    ![alt text](Images/KeyPair.png "Logo Title Text 1")

    We will use this key pair later to decrypt the administrator login for the server(s) we create.


#### Creating Windows instances
These steps walk through creating a number of Windows Instances.  
Licences for the windows instances themselves are contained in the running cost(s) of the instance(s).  
There are a number of instance types we can use (https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) but we are going to use the medium General Instance types (T and M) for this demonstration. 


1. From the Console Services menu go to:
    * Compute -> EC2 
    * Instances -> Instances 
    * Click “Launch new Instance”

2. On the first screen ensure you select the correct Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
Either type “windows” into the search bar (and hit enter) or scroll down.
Using either method find the AMI: **Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Base**  
Select this AMI, this will take you to the next screen.

3. Choose “t2.medium” on the “Choose an Instance Type” screen.

4. On the “Configure Instance Details” screen select the following:
    * Number of instances: 5
    * Network: Demo VPC
    * Subnet: Demo Public Subnet A (or B or C)
    * Leave the rest of the settings as they are.
    * Hit Review and Launch. Then Launch.

5. When you hit Launch it will ask you for the key pair to use; this will be the one you created earlier. So “Choose an existing key pair” from the drop down and then select the demo key pair from earlier (this should be the default). 
Acknowledge the message and “Launch Instances”.

    The key pair is important as it is the only way to de-crypt the administrator password for that instance, so if you do not have the key pair you created earlier then you will not be able to decrypt the password and login.

    You will be presented with the confirmation screen that you have created the instances and you can now “View Instances” and see what you have created.


##### Connect to one of the instances.
Once the instances are running state and both status check are passed we can connect. 
The network has been setup to allow remote connections from the internet; this would generally be bad practice however these servers will be destroyed after this test.  
The network itself is described and created in the original YAML file that was run earlier; you can open this file and see how the entire network was created.

1. Select an instance and choose connect – this will bring up a dialog box which you can then follow the instructions.   
2. To retrieve the administrator password it will ask you for the PEM file which you created earlier; remember where you stored this on disk and provide it to the screen, this will decrypt the password.  
This is actually an important security step, it means that if you do not have a key (previously) you will not be able to connect to that instance. The downloads of the keys only happens once (at creation) so you cannot download someone else key and connect into the instance.
3. Use the download RDP link provided and it will launch in the Microsoft Remote Desktop software you installed earlier (or on Windows is inbuilt).

4. Once logged in you are now connected to one of the instances that are running within your cloud.

5. Log out of the instance.

6. Once finished terminate the instances.
