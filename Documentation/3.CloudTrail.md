Connect into CloudTrail

On the initial screen click “View all events”
This screen now shows all of the acitivites within the account (i.e. all things we have just done!)
So scroll down and look for events such as:
Create-bucket
Or RunInstances

In both these cases you can see actions we have done above and the audit trail for those actions.
